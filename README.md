# Cooperative Intersection Maneuvering System

This project aims to create a Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Intersection Maneuvering System simulated using Carla. It involves the creation of a central CIMS agent that suggests suitable throttle values for the vehicles nearing an intersection in order to facilitate their safe passage while optimizing traffic flow.
